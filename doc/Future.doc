Ideas for future additions to MiniGL:

Reduction of pr vertex calculations
----------------------------------- 
GL_EXT_clip_volume_hint:
www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/Version1.2/EXTspecs/clip_volume_hint.txt

enable: glHint(CLIP_VOLUME_CLIPPING_HINT_EXT, GL_FASTEST)
disable: glHint(CLIP_VOLUME_CLIPPING_HINT_EXT, GL_DONT_CARE)

This extension provides a way of hinting to the pipeline
that the primitives can be assumed to be within the frustum,
thus in the case of MiniGL, outcodes could be completely bypassed. In addition, projection could be combined with transformation.
It would make sense to set this hint in all situations where bounding-geometry is fully within the frustum.
A good place to start with the implementation would be
glDrawElements pipeline - locked arrays case, since it already has similar functionality (Clip_Volume_Bypass).


API overhead reduction
----------------------
GL_EXT_multi_draw_arrays:
The specification allows 1 function call to draw multiple
arrays or indices with the same primitive type.
